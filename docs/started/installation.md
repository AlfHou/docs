# Install NetDaemon

There are two ways of running NetDaemon, as an add-on running under Home Assistant (previously known as hass.io) or as a docker container.

## Install as a Home Assistant add-on

1. Add the `https://github.com/net-daemon/homeassistant-addon` in `Add new repository URL` to the add-on store.

2. Add the NetDaemon add-on.

If you want to use the autogenerated entities on startup set that setting to true in add-on configuration. It is off default.

3. After you install it, do not start it just yet. We need to configure some stuff manually (will be improved as we come closer to release). See App Development for details.

## Install as a docker container


The docker container needs 3 enviroment variables to run properly.

env | description
-- | --
HASS_HOST | The host that is running Home Assistant (defaults to `localhost`).
HASS_PORT | The port Home Assistant is running on (default to `8123`).
HASS_TOKEN  | A Long Lived Acces Token(LLAT) that NetDaemon can use for the comminication with Home Assistant.
HASS_GEN_ENTITIES | Defaults to False, set True if you want the autogenerated entities

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name netdaemon \
  --restart=always \
  -e HASS_HOST=192.168.1.1 \
  -e HASS_TOKEN=XXXXX \
  -e HASS_GEN_ENTITIES=False \
  -v ~/netdaemon_config:/data \
  netdaemon/netdaemon
```
