title: Auto generated API

NetDaemon has en experimental support for generating helper entities for your enitites in your installation. I does not support all entity types for now but will be added more and more as we add more specific support in the fluent API. The autogenerated stuff will expand with helpers for service calls etc. in the future.

## Generated entities

Example of generated entities:

```csharp

using Netdaemon.Generated.Extensions;

public override async Task InitializeAsync()
{

    // Turn on a light generated from your entities
    await this.LightEx().BedroomWindow.TurnOn().ExecuteAsync();

    // Play mediaplayer generated from your entities
    await this.MediaPlayerEx().PlexPlayer.Play().ExecuteAsync();
}

```
