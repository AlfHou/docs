The application model is the information and services that is handled by the NetDaemon runtime related to the application instance. Instancing an app is the first step you do starting your automations in NetDaemon.

## Instancing applications
To instance an app you just have to use a simple attribute `[NetDaemonApp]` on any class and the NetDaemon runtime will instance it and run it.
